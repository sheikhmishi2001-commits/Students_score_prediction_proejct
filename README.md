# Students_score_prediction_proejct
This project predicts students’ exam scores based on their study hours and performance factors using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized before applying regression models. Both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression are trained and compared to evaluate prediction accuracy.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
1.Python
2.Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4.Scikit-learn

📊 Workflow
1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values and prepare dataset.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize study hours vs scores.
3.Model Training – Apply Linear & Polynomial Regression.
4.Evaluation – Compare models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.
5.Visualization – Plot predictions vs actual values.

🚀 Results
Linear Regression provides a good baseline for predictions.
Polynomial Regression improves prediction performance for non-linear trends.
